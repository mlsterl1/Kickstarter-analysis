### Summary

>Kickstarter theater and play campaigns have a higher success than failure rate. Timing of campaign is important as is the range of the expected campaign goal. An ideal campaign launch of May with a campaign goal of less than 5,000.00 USD is ideal. The analysis is limited to a review between 2009 and 2017 which may not reflect the most current trends in kickstarter campaings.
